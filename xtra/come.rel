Ciao Sergio:

Child -> Parent || Parent -> Child || Inherits:
                   (inverse)

is Kind Of      || Includes        || every feature
is Kind Of*     || Includes*       || at least one feature
is Part Of      || Contains        || no inheritance
is Bound To     || Binds           || no inheritance


Allowed relationships:

(1) PRX "is Kind Of"  PRX
(2) BIM "is Part Of"  BIM
(3) BIM "is Kind Of*" BIM
(4) MOL "is Part Of"  MOL
(5) MOL "is Kind Of*" MOL
(6) MOL "is Part Of"  BIM
(7) MOL "is Bound To" PRX
(8) BIM "is Part Of"  PRX


As you see I included the novel relationship called "is Bound To". The
reason I did it that the molecule which is bound to changes chemically
and is, strictly speaking, the different entity. Example: we can say
that the protein binds pyridoxal-5'-phosphate but the resulting
substructure has no aldehyde group and is therefore different from
"free" pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, so pyridoxal-5'-phosphate IS NOT A PART
of that protein.

Does it make sense?
